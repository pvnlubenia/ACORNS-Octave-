  ACORNS: Absolute COncentration Robustness of Networks of Shinar-feinberg type

=================================================================================

GNU Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) was used to develop the functions used here.



=========
Functions
=========The function acr returns a list of species (together with the Shinar-Feinberg (SF) pair associated with each and the deficiency of the building block subnetwork containing the SF-pair) with absolute concentration robustness (ACR) in a chemical reaction network (CRN), if they exist. ACR in a species is checked for each SF-pair even if the species is already determined to have ACR considering a different SF-pair. If no species is found or the network is not of SF-type, a message appears saying so.

The output variables 'model', 'R', 'F', and 'ACR_species' allow the user to view the following, respectively:

   - Complete network with all the species listed in the 'species' field of the structure 'model'
   - Matrix of reaction vectors of the network
   - Kinetic order matrix of the network
   - List of species with ACR

acr uses the following functions:     1. model_species
           - OUTPUT: Creates a complete model structure where the species list is filled out. The output variables 'model' and 'm' allow the user to view the complete model and the number of species, respectively.
           - INPUT: model: a structure representing the CRN (see details below)

     2. stoich_matrix           - OUTPUT: Creates the stoichiometric matrix of the system. The output variables 'N', 'reactant_complex', 'product_complex', and 'r' allow the user to view the stoichiometric matrix, matrix of reactant complexes, matrix of product complexes, and number of reactions, respectively.
           - INPUTS
                - model: a structure representing the CRN (see details below)
                - m: number of species

====
Note
====

acr2 is the same as acr but returns each species (together with the SF-pair associated with it and the deficiency of the building block block subnetwork containing the SF-pair) with ACR as they are found, if they exist. The time elapsed is also shown per species found and the end of the running time. This is perfect for networks with high rank and a lot of SF-pairs. An alphabetical list of the species is also returned at the end.



=================================
How to fill out 'model' structure
=================================

'model' is the input for the function acr. It is a structure, representing the CRN, with the following fields:

   - id: name of the model
   - species: a list of all species in the network; this is left blank since incorporated into the function is a step which compiles all species used in the model
   - reaction: a list of all reactions in the network, each with the following subfields:
        - id: a string representing the reaction
        - reactant: has the following further subfields:
             - species: a list of strings representing the species in the reactant complex
             - stoichiometry: a list of numbers representing the stoichiometric coefficient of each species in the reactant complex (listed in the same order of the species)
        - product: has the following further subfields:
             - species: a list of strings representing the species in the product complex
             - stoichiometry: a list of numbers representing the stoichiometric coefficient of each species in the product complex (listed in the same order of the species)
        - reversible: has the value true or false indicating if the reaction is reversible or not, respectively
        - kinetic: has the following further subfields:
             - reactant1: a list of numbers representing the kinetic order of each species in the reactant complex in the left to right direction (listed in the same order of the species)
             - reactant2: a list of numbers representing the kinetic order of each species in the reactant complex in the right to left direction (listed in the same order of the species) (empty if the reaction is not reversible)

Note that for the functions acr and acr2:

     1. It is assumed that the CRN has a positive equilibrium.
     2. It is also assumed that the CRN has power law kinetics.
     3. The CRN should have at least 2 species and 2 reactions (to form an SF-pair).
     4. Notes 2 and 3 imply that we assume the CRN is a power law system of SF-type.
     5. This code is based largely on [2] with modifications based on [5].
