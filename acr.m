# OUTPUT: Returns a list of species (and the Shinar-Feinberg (SF) pair        #
#            associated with them) with absolute concentration robustness     #
#            (ACR) in a chemical reaction network (CRN), if they exist. Once  #
#            ACR in a species is found, other SF-pairs associated with the    #
#            species are skipped. If no species is found or the network is    #
