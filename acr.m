# OUTPUT: Returns a list of species (together with the Shinar-Feinberg (SF)   #
#            pair associated with each and the deficiency of the building     #
#            block subnetwork containing the SF-pair) with absolute           #
#            concentration robustness (ACR) in a chemical reaction network    #
#            (CRN), if they exist. ACR in a species is checked for each       #
#            SF-pair even if the species is already determined to have ACR    #
#            considering a different SF-pair. If no species is found or the   #
