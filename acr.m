# OUTPUT: Returns a list of species (and the Shinar-Feinberg (SF) pair        #
#            associated with them) with absolute concentration robustness     #
#            (ACR) in a chemical reaction network (CRN), if they exist. Once  #
#            ACR in a species is found, other SF-pairs associated with the    #
#            species is skipped. If no species is found or the network is not #
#            of SF-type, a message appears saying so.                         #

#           2. It is also assumed that the CRN has power law kinetics.        #
